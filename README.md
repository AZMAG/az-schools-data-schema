## Overview

### What is a Longitudinal Data System?

Longitudinal Database design schema for Arizona schools data

An education longitudinal data system is a data system that collects and maintains detailed, high quality, school data that are linked across entities and over time, providing a complete academic and performance history for each school, district, county, and state; and makes these data accessible through reporting and analysis tools.

Longitudinal means that data on a given school can be connected across years.
